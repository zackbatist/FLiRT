# Flexible Lithic Recording Tool [FLiRT]
FLiRT is a database interface designed to facilitate the irregular, iterative, and non-linear workflows that are commonly employed in lithic analysis. Specifically, it is designed to facilitate workflows that tack back and forth between recording assemblage-level and artefact-level data – often beginning with the former and subsequently adding the latter – and that may involve addition of particular kinds of data for limited subsets of artefacts.
